5.	Problem type: Designing Test Approach

Context and problem statement:
ABC is a very large global bank providing services linked to retail banking, private banking, investment banking, insurance, leasing, loan and card related services. This bank has a single platform, a website for consumers to provide these services. The website supports two languages, English and Arabic and has many webpages, close to 300 with integration to many other back-end systems at the bank. 
The business of ABC bank is not happy with the design and layout of this website. The business thinks that the design is old, not user friendly and intuitive. There is no ‘wow’ effect on the website to delight the customer while using it. In general, the business thinks that the user experience is bad, directly impacting the business of the bank and customer experience. 
The business of ABC bank has asked the bank IT to initiate “website redesign” project. The objective of the project is to:
1.	Create new layout, look & feel of the website
2.	Make website more user friendly and enhance user experience
3.	Redevelop/redesign all front-end web pages of website
4.	The project does not include changes to back-end (database) and API layer
5.	The project does not include changes to business workflows, there should absolutely be no change to website functionality.
6.	There is no data migration involved.

1.	Write high level testing approach in 200-300 words
2.	Which testing types would you like to perform?
3.	Assuming scrum model of delivery, what are your testing KPIs?
